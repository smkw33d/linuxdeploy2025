# Linux Deploy
Copyright (C) 2012-2019  Anton Skshidlevsky, [GPLv3](https://github.com/meefik/linuxdeploy/blob/master/LICENSE)
This application is open source software for quick and easy installation of the operating system (OS) GNU/Linux on your Android device.
The application creates a disk image or a directory on a flash card or uses a partition or RAM, mounts it and installs an OS distribution. Applications of the new system are run in a chroot environment and working together with the Android platform. All changes made on the device are reversible, i.e. the application and components can be removed completely. Installation of a distribution is done by downloading files from official mirrors online over the internet. The application can run better with superuser rights (root).
The program supports multi language interface. You can manage the process of installing the OS, and after installation, you can start and stop services of the new system (there is support for running your scripts) through the UI. The installation process is reported as text in the main application window. During the installation, the program will adjust the environment, which includes the base system, SSH server, VNC server and desktop environment. The program interface can also manage SSH and VNC settings.

## Building from Source

This fork includes customized deployment scripts in the `custom_env/` directory. Before building, apply the custom Ubuntu deployment scripts:

```bash
# Apply custom Ubuntu deployment scripts
mkdir -p app/src/main/assets/env/include/bootstrap/ubuntu/
cp custom_env/include/bootstrap/ubuntu/* app/src/main/assets/env/include/bootstrap/ubuntu/
mkdir -p app/src/main/assets/env/include/bootstrap/debian/debootstrap/scripts/
cp custom_env/include/bootstrap/debian/debootstrap/scripts/* app/src/main/assets/env/include/bootstrap/debian/debootstrap/scripts/
```

Alternatively, you can use rsync for more reliable synchronization:

```bash
rsync -av custom_env/include/bootstrap/ubuntu/ app/src/main/assets/env/include/bootstrap/ubuntu/
rsync -av custom_env/include/bootstrap/debian/debootstrap/scripts/ app/src/main/assets/env/include/bootstrap/debian/debootstrap/scripts/
```

See `custom_env/README.md` for details about the customizations.
